## General-info
The “Sorting Visualiser” project is basically a web development project 
which is used to visualize the sorting algorithms and performs the 
operation of algorithms step by step as the algorithms works like Bubble 
Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort etc. We shuffle the bars in a random 
order that is in a unsorted order. We perform sorting algorithms on these
bars to sort these bars in a ascending order by applying the different 
algorithms by clicking on the buttons of these sorting algorithms.
## Technologies
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) JAVASCRIPT
4) BOOTSTRAP
## Features
•  Shuffle bars: Users can easily shuffle the bars in random order i.e. with 
    small height or large height of bars.
    
•  Colours used: Colours should be used to show whether or not anything is
    being compared.
    
•   Observe the swapping of bars: when a user’s apply any sorting 
    algorithms by clicking the button than these bars start sorting by 
    swapping according to their height.
